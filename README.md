# ðŸ§  DL:BitByBit

**DL:BitByBit** is my personal playground where I try to build deep learning models from scratch, piece by piece. Think of it like a DIY project, but for neural networks, with all the wiring, bugs, and triumphs along the way. 

## Goal

No fancy TensorFlow or PyTorch just yet. Like cooking a dish from the scratch (I enjoy cooking btw). As I said, this is more for me to learn and reflect.

> If you want to *really* understand how neural networks work under the hood, there are tons of excellent resources out there. This repo? It's just my personal adventure in deep learning. You're welcome to tag along, but don't expect production-ready code just yet.

## What's Inside

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mlp/` | A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (yes, with backpropagation and everything! You'll see when it's less of a mess) |
| `gpt/` | Coming Soon (Yet to start wrestling with Transformers) |
|`more will follow`| |
---

## How to Use

Well, you can always clone it. Here's how you can jump into the madness:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DL-BitByBit.git
cd DL-BitByBit
# To run the MLP or other models when available!
python mlp/mlp.py
```

## Contribute (or Just watch the Mess)

This is more of a one man show (for now atleast), but if you want to contribute, point out buggs, or laugh at my terrible code, feel free to open an issue or just make a pull request. I love and appreciate the feedback, even if it's just an emoji (don't mean this, tbh)

[**Andrej Karpathy**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) : A huge thank you to Andrej! while I never had any problem understanding the math, I always needed a good starting point and this playlist in particular is like a *treasure trove*. Seriously, can't recommend it enough. 

[**3B1B**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi): I've always followed 3B1B for the great physiscs and Math content. But why this playlist? coz it's *fire*. It helped me a ton in visualizing and understanding.
